# client-Chat
Client side C




This is a chat client. Very basic at the moment and not the greatest organization as i just created this. This skeleton code will be used for
an application I am creating thing that can be modified in this application are organization as well as the method read()
 we could use fread() in the future as the read function calls directly to the UNIX OS which is expensive and fread() could 
 possibly be more efficent as well as being part of the C language.
